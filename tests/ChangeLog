2006-08-06 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* aspath_test.c: (validate) Fix the sense of the aspath_loop_check,
	  which was the wrong way around and had actually been testing for
	  aspath_loop_check to be buggy.

2006-05-28 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* test-sig.c: (main) configure logging, there's no terminal
	  to write to for one thing, but we do want stdout, and we
	  don't want a test to spam syslog.

2006-03-16 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* heavy-wq.c: (heavy_wq_init) delay is gone from workqueue
	  spec.

	  ASNs.
	  ({empty_prepend,prepend,parse}_test) add static qualifiers

	  compare tests.
	  Add a segment identical to seq1, but with one extra asn.

	  no stream was allocated (empty path data).

2005-10-11 Paul Jakma <paul.jakma@sun.com>

	* test-privs.c: Privileges unit test.

2004-09-05 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* heavy-wq.c: (slow_func_del,slow_func_err) make them take
	  void * argument to shut up silly gcc warning.
	  
2004-05-25 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* main.c: new file, common 'main' portion which then calls
	  test_init.
	* heavy.c: remove common portions now in 'main.
	* heavy-wq.c: ditto
	* heavy-thread.c: ditto
	* heavy*.c: Set the slow_function iteration number lower, to 300, it
	  was several orders of magnitude too 'slow' to be useful. :)
	* Makefile.am: main is a source of the tests. heavy should link
	  to the math library.

2004-05-22 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* heavy-thread.c: Andrew Schorr's adaptation of heavy.c to use a
	  background thread to avoid responsiveness problems.
	* Makefile.am: Build heavythread

2004-05-21 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	  tracers, etc..)

2004-05-19 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* heavy.c: test programme to show how long-running functions
	  kill responsiveness. Demonstrating the most niggly problem
